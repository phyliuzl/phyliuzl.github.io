I'm Zelong LIU, a tenure-track researcher of theorerical physics at [IHEP](http://english.ihep.cas.cn) in Beijing. My research interests focus on perturbative quantum field theory and collider physics. My publication can be found in [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1272415). 


Research Interests
======

Standard Model Phenomenology 
------
Precision tests of the Standard Model in particle physics is essential to understand the fundamental particles and their interaction comprehensively and accurately. Any deviation between experimental data and theoretical predictions could indicate the presence of new physics beyond the Standard Model. 

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located at CERN near Geneva offers an excellent platform to explore the properties of elementary particles and forces at extremely high energies and tiny scales. The primary particles collided at the LHC are protons, consisting of quarks and gluons (also called partons). Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a quantum field theory describing the strong forces, which govern the interaction between partons. Perturbative QCD is a powerful approach to investigate the theoretical predictions of QCD processes. In practice, various obersevables at hadron colliders receive sizable corrections from perturbative QCD, e.g. Higgs and top quark productions. Therefore, higher-order QCD calculations play a key role in explaining the experimental results and in revealing the properties of fundamental particles.
