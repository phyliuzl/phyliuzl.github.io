Infrared singularities of QCD amplitudes with a massive parton		The knowledge of infrared singularities of gauge-theory amplitudes enables us to systematically resum large logarithmic corrections to many important observables. In this talk, I will present the structure of anomalous dimensions governing infrared singularities of QCD amplitudes with one massive and an arbitrary number of massless external partons. The analytical expression of tripole correlations involving one massive parton is obtained at three loops for the first time. The results are essential to improve the theoretical predictions of single top and top quark pair productions at hadron colliders.
